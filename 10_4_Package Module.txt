Managing Package Module Streams
--------------------------------
1. RHEL8 introduces the concept Application Streams
2. Modularity - allows a single repository to host multiple versions of an application's package
   and its dependencies.
3. RHEL8 content is distributed through 2 main software repositories--> BaseOS and AppStream
   BaseOS - This repository provides the core OS content for RHEL as RPM packages
   AppStream - This repository provides content with both modules and traditional RPM packages.

  What is a Module?
  A module is a set of RPM packages that are a consistent set that belong together. 

4. Module Streams - Each module can have one or more module streams, which hold different versions of the
   content.
Note: Module streams must be enabled in order to install their modules. To simplify this process, when a module is installed, it enables its module
streams if necessary.

5. Managing Modules using YUM
        yum module list ==>  To display a list of available modules
        yum module list perl
        yum module info perl
        yum module remove perl
        yum mosule disable perl
        yum module list --installed ==> to display list of installed modules
        yum module install python36:3.6
