Managing User Passwords
------------------------------
1. User Passwords are stored in /etc/shadow file and Group passwords are stored in /etc/gshadow file
2. Format of /etc/shadow file :
 <user_name>:Encrypted_Password:The_Day_Password_Last_Changed:Minimum number of days between password change:
 Maximum number of days between password change:Warning Period:Inactivity Period
3. Setup password policies using chage command. All changes would be recorded within /etc/shadow file
	useradd devops
	grep devops /etc/shadow [ We should see !! in the password field ]
	passwd devops [ We should see an encrypted password in the password field ]
	chage -l devops [ list the password policies fordevops user ]
	==> Set Min. no. of days to 3, Max. no. of days 30, Warning period to 5 and Inactivity period to 2 
	chage -m 3 -M 30 -W 5 -I 2 devops
	To set the account expiry date to 31.12.2021
	chage -E 2021-12-31 devops
	To revert back the expiry date to "never"
	chage -E -1 devops
	grep devops /etc/shadow

4. To create a password-less linux user 
     passwd -d devops
5. To force a user to change his/her password at next login :
     chage -d 0 devops

6. Format of an Encrypted Password
   -------------------------------
   The encrypted password stores 3 pieces of information -
	a. the hashing algorithm :: The number 6 represents SHA-512 has [ SHA=Secure Hash Algorithm ] which
	is the default in RHEL7 and RHEL8. The number 1 indicates MD5 [Message Digest 5 ] and the number
	5 indicates a SHA-256
 
	b. the salt :: It is used to encrypt the password. It provides random vales.
	
        c. the encrypted hash :: The salt and the unencrypted password are combined and encrypted to 
	   generate the encrypted hash of the password
 
        passwd <username>
        Enter password : redhat
	Retype password : redhat
        
        A salt value will be generated randomly and the it will combined with the unencrypted password
        i.e. redhat here and then the combined string would be encrypted using the hashing algorithm.

        redhat[uncrypted]+Rs#%12e[salt]----[sha512]---> redhatRs#%12e [encrypted hash]
        redhat[uncrypted]+slp#%34e[salt]----[sha512]---> redhatslp#%34e [encrypted hash]
