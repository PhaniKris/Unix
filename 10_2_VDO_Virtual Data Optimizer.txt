VDO ==> Virtual Data Optimizer..Was introduced in RHEL 7.5 Beta
---------------------------------------------------
What is VDO? It is a kernel module that can save disk space and reduce replication bandwidth
It sits on top of any block storage device and provides zero-block elimination, deduplication
of redundant blocks and data compression
----------------------------------------------------
1. RHEL8 includes the VDO driver, which optimizes the data footprint on the block devices.
2. VDO is Linux device mapper driver that reduces disk space usage on block devices and
   minimizes the replication of data, saving disk space.
3. VDO includes 2 kernel modules : kvdo [ used for data compression ] and uds [ for deduplication ]
4. The VDO layer is placed on top of an existing block storage device such as a RAID device or
   a local disk. The storage layers, such as LVM Logical Volumes and File Systems, are placed
   on of a VDO device.
5. The logical devices that we creae using VDO are called VDO volumes. 
6. VDO volumes are similar to disk partitions, we can format the volumes with the desired filesystem and 
   mount it like a regular filesystem. We can also use VDO volume as an LVM Physical volume.
