Reset root password in RHEL7/RHEL8
---------------------------------
Steps:
-----
1. Reboot the system
2. Interrupt the boot loader countdown by pressing any key except Enter
3. Move the cursor to the kernel entry to boot
4. Press e to edit the selected entry
5. Move the cursor to the kernel commnd line(the line that starts with linux)
6. Append rd.break. With that option, the system breaks just before the system hands control from the initramfs
   to the actual system.
7. Press ctrl+x to boot with the changes
8. At this point, the system presents a root shell, with the actual root filesystem on the disk mounted 
   read-only on /sysroot. We need to remount the root filesystem in read-write mode.
	mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
9. Switch into chroot jail, where /sysroot is treated as the root of the file-system tree.
	chroot /sysroot
10. Set a new password for root user
	passwd root
11. Ensure that all unlabelled files, including /etc/shadow at this point, get relabeled during boot
        touch /.autorelabel
12. Type exit command twice. The first command exits the chroot jail and the second command exits the
    initramfs debug shell
