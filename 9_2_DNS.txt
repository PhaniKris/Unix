DNS ==> Domain Name System
1. It is a hierarchical naming system that servers as a directory of networked hosts and resources.
2. FQDN => Fully Qualified Domain Name   server1.example.com
3. Authoritative and Non-Authoritative nameserver
4. Name Resolution / Lookup ==> Forward Lookup [ Name to IP ] and Reverse Lookup [ IP to Name ]
5. For a Domain, we need to configure Zone files ==> Forward Lookup Zone file & Reverse Lookup Zone file 
6. DNS Query==> Recursive [ workload is on the DNS Network ] & Iterative [ workload is on client ] 
7. Name Service Switch file ==> /etc/nsswitch.conf
8. DNS client tools ==> nslookup / host / dig
9. Domain ==> is a collection of resource records.
   DNS Resouce Records [RR ] ==> SOA [ Start Of Authority ] / NS [ Name Server ] 
   A [ Address Record ==> Name to IP /  CNAME [ Canonical Name ==> Alias ] 
   MX [ Mail Exchanger ] /  PTR [ Pointer Record ==> IP to Name ]
10. A Resource Record contains a TTL, a Class, a Type, Data elements
     OWNER-NAME			TTL		CLASS		TYPE		DATA
     www.example.com.   	300		IN		A		192.168.1.100
     a.root-servers.net.   	604800		IN		AAAA		2001:503:ba3e::2:30
     www-dev.example.com.       30              IN              CNAME           lab.example.com.

11. Package Name : bind   bind-utils
    Daemon : named
    Configuration File : /etc/named.conf
    Zone Files location : /var/named
    Port : 53
   yum install bind bind-utils
   systemctl start named
   systemctl enable named
   systemctl status named


named-checkconf ==>  to check the syntax of named.conf file
named-checkzone example.com forward.zone ==> to check the syntax of the zone file

/etc/named.conf ==> 
listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 172.31.2.195; };
allow-query     { localhost; 0.0.0.0/0; };

zone "example.com" IN {
        type master;
        file "forward.zone";
};

cd /var/named
cp -p named.empty forward.zone

Note : If FTP server is running on a different host, we need to put an A record for the host and then create 
a CNAME record for the same.
ftp.example.com.		        IN	CNAME	ns1.example.com.
