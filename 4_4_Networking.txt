----------------------------
Upto RHEL5 ==> network service ===> service network start ===> /etc/init.d/network start
In RHEL6   ==> NetworkManager
In RHEL7/8 ==> NetworkManager is the default networking service

Network Interface Name : Upto RHEL6 ==> eth0, eth1....[eth stands for ethernet ]
RHEL7/RHEL8 ==>
 --> Ethernet interfaces begin with en
 --> WLAN inetrfaces begin with wl
 --> WWAN interfaces begin with ww
The rest of the interface name after the type will be based on information provided by server's firmware or determined by the
location of the device in the PCI topology.
  => oN indicates that this is an on-board device and the server's firmware provided index number. So eno1 is an on-board
    Ethernet device 1.
  => sN indicates that this device is in PCI hotplug slot N. So ens3 is an Ethernet card in PCI hotplug slot 3

To display the IP configuration ==> ifconfig  ///   ip a s
To display the default gateway ==> route -n    ///  netstat -r
To display the DNS server IP ==> cat /etc/resolv.conf

Upto RHEL6 ==> 
----------
To configure network ==> setup / system-conig-network

RHEL7/RHEL8 ==> nmtui / nmcli

Interface configuration file ==> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

To display hostname : upto RHEL6 ==> hostname
		      in RHEL7/RHEL8 ==> hostname / hostnamectl
If we change the machine name using hostname command, that is not permanent. If we need to make it persistent, then
we have to edit /etc/sysconfig/network file
But hostnamectl command makes the changes persistent by writing the entry in /etc/hostname file.
