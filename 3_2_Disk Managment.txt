Disk Management
-------------------------------
Partitioning Scheme : MBR [ Master Boot Record ] == GPT [ GUID Partition Table ]
MBR Partitioning Scheme -
------------------------
1. Since 1982, this partitioning schme has dictated how disks are partitioned on systems using BIOS firmware.
2. This scheme supports a maximum of 4 Primary Partitions
3. With the use of extenedd and logical partitions, admins can create a maximum of 15 partitions on Linux Systems. In MBR scheme, a partition can have a max size of 2 TiB
5. Logical partition always starts from 5

GPT Partitioning Scheme
-----------------------
1. For systems running UEFI [ Unified Extensible Firmware Interfcae ], GPT is the standard
2. Using GPT, we can create a maximum of 128 partitions
3. Supports partitions and disks of uptp 8 Zebibytes(ZiB) or 8 billion tebibytes.
4. A GPT uses a globally unique identifier(GUID) to identify each disk and partition.
5. In contrast to MBR which has a single point of failure(SPOF), a GPT offers redundancy of its partition 
   table information. The primary GPT resides at the head of the disk, while a backup copy, the secondary GPT
   is housed at the end of the disk

IDE/PATA ==> hda
SATA ==> sda
Vitual ==> vda
           vdb

Partitioning Tools :: parted / fdisk
lsblk ==> to list the block devices
fdisk -l /dev/sda
parted /dev/sda print
parted /dev/sda
parted>print

Note: In Linux, we do not have any drive letter concept like windows. We have mount point which is nothing
but a directory. This directory needs to be mapped with the disk partition. This mapping process is known
as Mounting. We use the mount command for this mounting/mapping process.

To display the block devices ==> lsblk
To display partition table => fdisk -l   /   parted
Partitioning Scheme :
A. MBR Partitioning scheme ==> MBR stands for Master Boot Record. This scheme has dictated how
   disks are partitioned on systems running BIOS firmware. 
    i) It supports a max of 4 primary partitions
    ii) Total no. of partitions that can be created is 15
    iii) Maximum size of a partition could be 2 TiB

Note : Partition no 1 to 4 is reserved for Primary partition. Logical partition always start
       from 5.

B. GPT Partitioning scheme ==> GPT stands for GUID Partition Table. It is for systems running
   UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
    i) No primary-extended-logical partition concept
    ii) Total no. of partitions that can be created is 128
    iii) Maximum size of a partition could be upto 8 Zebibyte(ZiB) or eight billion tebibytes
