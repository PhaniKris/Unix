Automated Installation
=====================
You can automate the installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux using a feature called Kickstart. Using Kickstart, you specify everything Anaconda needs to complete an installation, including disk partitioning, network interface configuration, package selection, and other parameters, in a Kickstart text file. By referencing the text file, Anaconda performs the installation without further user interaction.

Kickstart Installation Steps ==>
--------------------------------
1. Create a Kickstart file.

2. Publish the Kickstart file to the installer.

3. Boot Anaconda and point it to the Kickstart file.

Creating a Kickstart File
-------------------------
Use either of these methods to create a Kickstart file:

==> Use the Kickstart Generator website.
==> Use a text editor.

The Kickstart Generator website at https://access.redhat.com/labs/kickstartconfig/ presents dialog boxes for user inputs, and creates a Kickstart directives text file with the user's choices. Each dialog box corresponds to the configurable items in the Anaconda installer.

Publish the Kickstart File to Anaconda
-------------------------------------
Make the Kickstart file available to the installer by placing it in one of these locations:

==> A network server available at install time using FTP, HTTP, or NFS.
==> An available USB disk or CD-ROM.
==> A local hard disk on the system to be installed.

Boot Anaconda and Point it to the Kickstart File
Once a Kickstart method is chosen, the installer is told where to locate the Kickstart file by passing the inst.ks=LOCATION parameter to the installation kernel. Some examples:

inst.ks=http://server/dir/file
eg. inst.ks=http://192.168.1.254/ks-config/ks.cfg
inst.ks=ftp://server/dir/file

inst.ks=nfs:server:/dir/file


DISPLAYING THE DESKTOP WITH WAYLAND AND X
-----------------------------------------
Wayland is a client/server windowing system designed to replace X11. The performance improvements of Wayland over X11 are derived from the simplification of the architecture

Reasons to Switch to Wayland
• The X display server has become a bottleneck between clients, the compositor, and the kernel.
• X has legacy code such as the rendering API that is rarely used but must remain to conform to
the X11 protocol.

Verify Wayland is Being Used
----------------------------
Use the following steps to determine whether your desktop is using Wayland.
[user1 ~]$ loginctl
SESSION UID USER SEAT TTY
2 1000 user1 seat0 tty2
c1 42 gdm seat0 tty1
2 sessions listed.
[user@demo ~]$ loginctl show-session 2 -p Type
Type=wayland

Gnome 3 uses Wayland by default. However, not all applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 have
been migrated.

If Wayland is incompatible with your graphics hardware or application, it is a simple process to
revert to using Xorg. Uncomment the following line in /etc/gdm/custom.conf and then reboot
your machine.
#WaylandEnable=false

MANAGING USER AUTHENTICATION WITH AUTHSELECT
-------------------------------------------
INTRODUCING AUTHSELECT
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 ships with Authselect, which simplifies the configuration of user
authentication, and replaces Authconfig. Authselect uses a different and safer approach, based on
profiles that make configuration changes simpler for system administrators. Authselect is used to
configure the usual authentication parameters such as passwords, certificates, smart cards, and
fingerprints.

Features of Authselect
----------------------
• Adjusts PAM, NSS, and GNOME dconf settings.
• Ships with three ready-to-use profiles: sssd, winbind, and nis.
• pam_pwquality is enabled by default to enforce password quality restrictions on local users.


Comparing Authselect and Authconfig
-----------------------------------
• Authselect uses tested profiles, instead of directly modifying the system authentication
configuration files.
• Authselect only modifies files in /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/pam.d/*, and /etc/dconf/
db/distro.d/*.

How to Use Authselect
---------------------
• Use the authselect list command to list the default and custom profiles.
• The default profiles are stored in /usr/share/authselect/default.
• Use the authselect create-profile command to create new custom profiles.
• Custom profiles are stored in the /etc/authselect/custom/ directory.


Practice
-------
1. Authselect is installed by default in RHEL 8. Review the available options
	authselect --help
2. List the available Authselect profiles.
	authselect list
3. List the currently selected Authselect profile
	authselect surrent
4. Determine if the current configuration is valid
	authselect check
5. Print the Authselect profile requirements
	authselect requirements sssd
6. Show the Authselect profile details and optional features
	authselect show sssd
7. Select an Authselect profile
	authselect select sssd
8. Review the contents of /etc/nsswitch.conf
	grep sss /etc/nsswitch.conf
9. Select another Authselect profile on servera to compare
	authselect select nis
10. Review the contents of /etc/nsswitch.conf
	grep nis /etc/nsswitch.conf
