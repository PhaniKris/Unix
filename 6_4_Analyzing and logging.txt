Analyzing and Storing Logs
---------------------------
1. Processes and the operating system kernel record a log of events that happen. These logs are used to audit
   the system and troubleshoot problems.
2. Log files are generally kept in the /var/log directory. These logs can be inepcted using normal text utilities
   such as less and tail.
3. Two daemons are responsible for logging in RHEL - rsyslog and systemd-journald

4. The  /etc/rsyslog.conf  file  is the main configuration file for the rsyslogd which logs system messages on
   *nix systems.
        The rsyslog service uses the facility and priority of log messages to determine how to handle them.
   Send a syslog message manually
   ------------------------------
   The logger command can send messages to the rsyslog service. By default, it sends the message to the user
   facility with the notice priority(user.notice) unless specified otherwise with the -p option
        logger -p local7.notice "Log entry got created on host" ==> /var/log/boot.log
