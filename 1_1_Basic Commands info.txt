        Visual Modes of vim ==> (Selection for copy) within file
	a. Character Mode - v
	b. Line Mode - V
	c. Block Mode - <CTRL>+v

19. Linux Filesystem Hierarchy -> All files in Linux system are stored on file systems, which are organized into
    a single inverted tree of directories known as file-system hierarchy.

  ==> which command displays the path of a Binary File

20. User and Group Administration ==>
     a.	A user account is used to provide security boundary for a specifc user
     b. 3 main types of user accounts - superuser [ Privileged user ], system users and regular 
        users [non-privileged users] 		
	The name of superuser is root and the it has UID 0
	Users do NOT interactively login using system user accounts
     c. id command can be used to display user information
     d. Every user is assigned a unique UID by the OS
     e. To create a user ==> useradd <username>
	By default, system uses the /etc/passwd file to store user information.
	Each line in /etc/passwd file contains information about one user and it contains 7 fields
	separated by ':'
    username:password(x):UID:GID:GECOS Field:Home Directory:Login Shell
     
   Group ==> is collection of users.
     a. Each group will have a unique GID. root users has default GID 0
     b. Group information is stored in /etc/group file
	groupadd sysadmin
     c. Each line in /etc/group file contains information about one group
	groupname:group_password(x):group_id:list_of_group_members

     d. userdel <username> ==> deletes a user account but home directory still exists
        userdel -r <username> ==> deletes a user account along with the home directory
     e. usermod -c "DevOps Enginner" sarah
     f. User password are stored in a file called /etc/shadow
     g. How to Lock a user account?
	 usermod -L(Lock) <username>
	 usermod -U(Unlock) <username>
     g. UID Ranges : 
		UID 0 is reserved for root user
		UID 1-200 is a range of "system users" assigned statically to system processes by Redhat
		UID 201-999 is a range of "system users" used by system processes that do not own files in the
		filesystem.
		UID 1000+ is the range of "regular users"
     h. User and group specific default values are stored in /etc/login.defs

   Primary Group and Secondary Group
   --------------------------------
   a. Whenever we create a user in Linux, a group is also created automatically in the same name of that user.
   One user can have only one Primary Group but can have multiple Secondary Group(s)
   
   head => It dislays first 10 lines of a file 
   head -n 5 => 5 lines
   tail => It dislays last 10 lines of a file 
   tail -n 5 => 5 lines
   
   b. root has a reserved GID as 0
   c. Create a group with a specifc group id ==> groupadd -g 10001 hr
   d. groupdel and groupmod commands are there like userdel and usermod
   e. Secondary Group assignment ==> usermod -G <group_name> <user_name> [ -G is for secondary group ]
      Primary Group assignment ==> usermod -g <group_name> <user_name>   [ -g is for primary group ]
