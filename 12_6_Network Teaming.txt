Network teaming
--------------
Network teaming is method for linking NICs together logically to allow for failover or higher throughput. Teaming is a new implementation that
 does not affect the older bonding driver in the Linux kernel; it offers an alternate implementation.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 implements network teaming with a small kernel driver and a userspace daemon, teamd. The kernel handles network packets
 efficiently and teamd handles logic and interface processing. Software, called runners, implement load balancing and active-backup
logic, such as roundrobin. 

The following runners are available to teamd:
• broadcast: a simple runner which transmits each packet from all ports.
• roundrobin: a simple runner which transmits packets in a round-robin fashing from each of the ports.
• activebackup: this is a failover runner which watches for link changes and selects an active port for data transfers.
• loadbalance: this runner monitors traffic and uses a hash function to try to reach a perfect balance when selecting ports for packet transmission.
• lacp: implements the 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol. Can use the same transmit port selection possibilities as the loadbalance runner.

Link Aggregation
----------------
--> The term link aggregation refers to various methods of combining (aggregating) multiple network connections in parallel in order to increase throughput
     beyond what a single connection could sustain, and to provide redundancy in case one of the links should fail. 

--> A link aggregation group (LAG) is the collection of physical ports combined together.

All network interaction is done through a team interface, composed of multiple network port interfaces. When controlling teamed port interfaces
 using NetworkManager, and especially when fault finding, keep the following in mind:

• Starting the network team interface does not automatically start the port interfaces.
• Starting a port interface always starts the teamed interface.
• Stopping the teamed interface also stops the port interfaces.
