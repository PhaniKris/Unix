Automating with RHEL System Roles
---------------------------------
RHEL8 includes Ansible system roles to simplify automation of complex tasks and configuration of RHEL subsystems.
Ansible==> is a configuration management tool and also an automation tool.
Ansible is agent-less
Python is a prerequisite for installing ansible. Ansible modules are written in python.
Password-less SSH authentication needs to be configured
Install Ansible ==> yum install ansible
To get help on a particular ansible module ==> ansible-doc <module_name>

To verify that no roles are initially available ==> ansible-galaxy list
Install the rhel-system-roles package to get Ansible system roles in RHEL8
System roles are located in ==> /usr/share/ansible/roles directory. A role beginning with linux-system-roles is a 
symlink to the matching rhel-system-roles role.

Ansible Configuration file ==> /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
Inventory file ==> /etc/ansible/hosts ==> Contains the list of hosts(FQDN,Name,IP address) which are to be managed by 
					  Ansible.


Perform the following tasks in the target host ==>
a. Install httpd package [ Module : yum ]
b. Start and Enable httpd service [ Module : service ]
c. Copy a Custom index.html page to the webserver [ Module : copy ]

Ansible Ad-Hoc commands
Playbook ==> is a collection of plays (tasks)
