DHCP ==> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
===============================================================
1. DHCP provides a method for systems to automatically retrieve thier network configuration parameters such as
IP address, Default Gateway, DNS server and Domains, NTP server...

2. By deploying a DHCP server centrally, we can control these parameters.

3. We allocate a range / pool of IP addresses to distribute to the clients.

4. DHCP can also provide Reserved IP to specific client / servers

5. DHCP handshaking ==> 
     a. When we configure a system as DHCP Client, it sends a DHCPDISCOVER packet to 255.255.255.255 broadcast
         destinantion.
     b. The DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER packet that contains its own IP address and an IP address
        that the client should use.

     c. The client then broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST packet, requesting the IP address that the DHCP server offers.

     d. After the DHCP server receives the DHCPREQUEST packet, it sends a DHCPACK packet acknowledging the
        client has exclusive right to the client IP address until the lease expires.

Steps to configure DHCP server
-----------------------------
i. Install the DHCP server package ==> yum install dhcp-server
ii. Start and Enable the service ==> systemctl enable --now dhcpd
                                     systemctl status dhcpd

iii. Allow dhcp service via firewalld
       firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=dhcp
       firewall-cmd --reload
iv. Copy the Sample configuration file in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
    cp /usr/share/doc/dhcp-server/dhcpd.conf.example /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
v. Make changes to the dhcpd.conf file as per the requirements

After modifying the dhcpd.conf file, save and quit
dhcpd -t [ to check the syntax ]
echo $? ==> If it returns 0, that means it ran successfully.
